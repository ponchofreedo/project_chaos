my 2017 portfolio...a long time coming experiment

# details
based off the Yeoman Webapp generator. to compensate for CMS-styled url directories, and because I didn't want to make too many apache changes, gulp css-url-to-absolute package is used.

the url that ill be hosting this on will be http://chaos.zachfreed.com. follow along with progress, if you so choose.

what im shooting for...
